# TWINE STYLING IN HTML AND CSS

_Part of a collection of resources and links related to the Twine digital storytelling platform, initially created for students in Digital Media Practice at Anglia Ruskin University._

Below are some *very* basic tips to style your project using simple HTML and CSS tags.

### IMAGES on your passages:

Images used in your Twine must be located online, and you insert them using their URL location. Remember my recommendation that you use the free online service [IMGUR](https://imgur.com/) for this purpose.

Step-by-step instructions:

1. Create an Imgur membership
2. Locate an image you want to use online.
3. Download the image to your harddrive (as a .jpg or .png file)
4. Upload the file to Imgur.
5. In your list of images on Imgur, click on an image, and note that all kinds of 'embed code' is provided on the right.
6. Click on the button to copy the 'Direct Link' (this is the URL address of your image).

7. Now, the easiest way to insert images into your project is to use a simple HTML code snippet, like so:

```Html
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F7Cv48x.jpg" alt="spongebob" width="300" height="128">
```
 
Note that you can manipulate the width and height of all images (the spongebob in my example is probably rather squashed.)
