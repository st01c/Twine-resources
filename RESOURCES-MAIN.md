# TWINE RESOURCES

A collection of resources and links related to the Twine digital storytelling platform, initially created for students in Digital Media Practice at Anglia Ruskin University.

_A note to students: These resources combine and streamline all the information provided on the module's Canvas site. For all your Twine-related needs, this is the place to come. However, you must consult the Canvas site and the university website for up-to-date information regarding your assessments, deadlines, and the submission of your work_.

## General suggestions, warnings, and advice
1. Use the **Chrome** web browser for your work in Twine.
2. Use the **web-based version** of Twine.
3. **Save** your work often!
   - When you use Twine online, your work will be saved only in the browser cache memory. It is therefore recommended that you frequently save your project, in order not to lose work.
   - While you are working on your project, click the _title_ of your project on the bottom left of the screen.
   - In the pup-up menu, the bottom item is "Publish to File". Click this option to save a .html file of your project to your harddrive.
   - Now, you can save this file on a USB stick, store it in the cloud, or email it to yourself.
   - _NOTE: Safari and other browsers don't function well with this saving option – this is why you should absolutely use Chrome!_
4. The Internet is your friend – consult the online resources provided below in the **Links** section, and do a simple Google search for any question/problem that arises... someone else has almost certainly encountered the same problem before, and has offered a solution online.
5. For this Twine project, make sure to use the **Harlowe** Twine theme – this is the theme used in all of the teaching exercises, and it offers the most comprehensive documentation/manual/online community.

- Twine [video tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLFgjYYTq6xyjBtXJTvEaBTVUWxirY6q24) (Created by 'VegetarianZombie' and hosted on YouTubeYouTube; this is a very extensive series of video tutorials using the Harlowe them. They cover much of the material we also covered in class, with topics ranging from absolute basics to advanced functions.)
   The following video tutorials may be particularly relevant for you:
  + 1-6: Basic introduction and coding functionality.
  + 7: Intro to using HTML and CSS in Twine 2.
  + 8: Local storage (aka: saving your work!)
  + 9: Hooks
  + 12: Using images (HTML) 
  + 13: Using images (CSS)
- [Reference manual](https://twine2.neocities.org/) for the Harlowe theme. (You can find detailed description and code examples for ALL functions found within the default Harlowe theme.)

## Some Twine terminology
_Use these terms when you search for online solutions to problems you encounter_.

The text boxes that make up your Twine project are called **passages**. The links between them are, not surprisingly, called **links**. The _code_ you will write to give your Twine project certain appearances and functionality draws on **HTML** and **CSS** syntax. It forms what in Twine is generally called **scripts** or **macros**. A very important part of your Twine code is **hooks**, which link together different parts of your code. More generally speaking, as in all coding/programming, you are, of course, designing **algorithms** or **functions** that use **variables**, **loops**, and **conditional (if/then) statements**.

## Great Twine projects to inspire you
_These are some Twine games and works of interactive fiction that showcase the functionality of Twine. The list is subjective and not comprehensive... there are 1000s of great Twine works out there! Expore on your own (for example by searching [itch.io](https://itch.io/) for 'twine' tags. Some of the Twine pieces collected below are poetry, others are longform fiction, still others are various kinds of games. Have a look around, enjoy a good read, and get some ideas for what you could do with Twine_.

### Code examples and tutorials for specific functions
(Additional material may be added here as we go along in the class.)
- Twine tutorial file created for students in the Digital Media Practice class.
   _This file contains many coding examples that you can try out, copy, or modify. Note that the tutorial file repeats some of the information also contained in this document_.
   Instructions:
   This is an .html file that you can import directly into Twine.
   - Begin by [downloading](https://github.com/st01c/Twine-resources/blob/master/_twine-files/DMP_TUTORIAL-file-v3.html) the file. To do so, **right-click the link** and save it to your harddrive.
   - Go to [Twine](http://twinery.org/) and click 'Import from File'.
   - Choose the tutorial file from your harddrive.
   - Use the tutorial file in two ways:
     - 'Play' the file like a normal Twine project – this allows you to see how the code works, i.e., what output it creates.
     - Open the individual passages in order to see the code. Here, you can copy some code for your own project, or modify it to see how it changes the behaviour of the Twine project.
- A tutorial for fine-tuning your Twine project to be [gender-inclusive](https://autistmouse.itch.io/gender-inclusive-twine-code-tutorial) (This tutorial, created by autistmouse and hosted on [itch.io](https://itch.io/), is created within Twine and works specifically with the Harlowe theme.)
