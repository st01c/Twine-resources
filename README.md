# Twine resources
A collection of resources and links related to the Twine digital storytelling platform, initially created for students in Digital Media Practice at Anglia Ruskin University

_A note to students: These resources combine and streamline all the information provided on the module's Canvas site. For all your Twine-related needs, this is the place to come. However, you must consult the Canvas site and the university website for up-to-date information regarding your assessments, deadlines, and the submission of your work_.
