A collection of resources and links related to the Twine digital storytelling platform, initially created for students in Digital Media Practice at Anglia Ruskin University.

_A note to students: These resources combine and streamline all the information provided on the module's Canvas site. For all your Twine-related needs, this is the place to come. However, you must consult the Canvas site and the university website for up-to-date information regarding your assessments, deadlines, and the submission of your work_.

## General suggestions, warnings, and advice
1. Use the **Chrome** web browser for your work in Twine.
2. Use the **web-based version** of Twine.
3. **Save** your work often! (see below for details on how to do that)
4. The Internet is your friend – consult the online resources provided below in the **Links** section, and do a simple Google search for any question/problem that arises... someone else has almost certainly encountered the same problem before, and has offered a solution online.
5. For this Twine project, make sure to use the **Harlowe** Twine theme – this is the theme used in all of the teaching exercises, and it offers the most comprehensive documentation/manual/online community.
