A collection of resources and links related to the Twine digital storytelling platform, initially created for students in Digital Media Practice at Anglia Ruskin University.

_A note to students: These resources combine and streamline all the information provided on the module's Canvas site. For all your Twine-related needs, this is the place to come. However, you must consult the Canvas site and the university website for up-to-date information regarding your assessments, deadlines, and the submission of your work_.

## General suggestions, warnings, and advice
1. Use the **Chrome** web browser for your work in Twine.
2. Use the **web-based version** of Twine.
3. **Save** your work often! (see below for details on how to do that)
4. The Internet is your friend – consult the online resources provided below in the **Links** section, and do a simple Google search for any question/problem that arises... someone else has almost certainly encountered the same problem before, and has offered a solution online.
5. For this Twine project, make sure to use the **Harlowe** Twine theme – this is the theme used in all of the teaching exercises, and it offers the most comprehensive documentation/manual/online community.

They cover much of the material we also covered in class, with topics ranging from absolute basics to advanced functions.)
   The following video tutorials may be particularly relevant for you:
  + 1-6: Basic introduction and coding functionality.
  + 7: Intro to using HTML and CSS in Twine 2.
  + 8: Local storage (aka: saving your work!)
  + 9: Hooks
  + 12: Using images (HTML) 
  + 13: Using images (CSS)
- [Reference manual](https://twine2.neocities.org/) for the Harlowe theme. (You can find detailed description and code examples for ALL functions found within the default Harlowe theme.)

## Some Twine terminology
_Use these terms when you search for online solutions to problems you encounter_.

The text boxes that make up your Twine project are called **passages**. The links between them are, not surprisingly, called **links**. The _code_ you will write to give your Twine project certain appearances and functionality draws on **HTML** and **CSS** syntax. It forms what in Twine is generally called **scripts** or **macros**. A very important part of your Twine code is **hooks**, which link together different parts of your code. More generally speaking, as in all coding/programming, you are, of course, designing **algorithms** or **functions** that use **variables**, **loops**, and **conditional (if/then) statements**.
